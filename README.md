## Description

The University Library Loan System is a comprehensive solution for managing document loans within a university library environment. This system provides efficient tracking of borrowed items, user information, and administrative functionalities for library assistants.

## Key Features

### User Management

- Add, modify, or delete users (students and faculty) with detailed information including name, surname, contact details, and additional attributes such as email for faculty and address for students.

### Document Management

- Classify documents as books or theses, each with specific attributes such as ISBN, title, author(s), publication date, publisher, number of copies, keywords, and a summary.

### Inventory Management

- Manage books with multiple copies, each identified by an inventory number and status, enabling efficient monitoring of item conditions and suggesting actions like repair or disposal.

### Loan Registration

- Facilitate the process of recording loan transactions within the library, ensuring proper tracking of loan duration, due dates, and notifications for users.
